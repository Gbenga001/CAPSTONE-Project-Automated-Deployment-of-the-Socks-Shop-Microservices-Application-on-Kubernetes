#Automated Deployment of the Socks Shop Microservices Application on Kubernetes#

#Overview#
This project focuses on the deployment of a microservices-based architecture, specifically the Socks Shop application, on Kubernetes. By leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaaC), the deployment is automated to ensure a fast, consistent, and reliable setup. The project emphasizes best practices in DevOps, including monitoring, logging, security, and maintainability.

#Project Objective#
The objective is to demonstrate the effective deployment of a microservices application using modern tools and methodologies. The key goals include:

*Automating Deployment: Utilize IaaC to automate the deployment process.
*Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring with Prometheus and logging to track application performance and operations.
*Security: Secure the application using HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt certificates and enforce network perimeter security.
*Maintainability: Ensure that the deployment scripts are clear, maintainable, and easily replicable.

#Prerequisites#
Before deploying the application, ensure that the following tools and services are available and configured:

*AWS Account: For provisioning infrastructure, including VPC and EKS clusters.
*Terraform: To define and deploy infrastructure resources.
*kubectl: For managing Kubernetes clusters.
*Helm: For packaging and deploying Helm charts.
*Prometheus & Grafana: For monitoring the application.
*Ansible: (Optional) For configuration management and handling sensitive information.
*Let’s Encrypt: For generating HTTPS certificates.
